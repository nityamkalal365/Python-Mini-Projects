# 🐍 Snake Game – Python Turtle Edition

A classic Snake Game built using Python's Turtle graphics module with an object-oriented design approach.  
The game includes dynamic food spawning, score tracking, high-score persistence, and collision detection.

---

## 🎮 Features

- 🔄 Smooth snake movement using screen tracer optimization
- 🍎 Randomly spawning food with dynamic color changes
- 📈 Score tracking with persistent high score storage
- 💥 Collision detection:
  - Wall collision
  - Self collision
- ♻️ Automatic game reset after collision
- 🧱 Modular OOP structure (separate classes for Snake, Food, Scorecard)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Turtle Graphics Module
- File Handling (for high score persistence)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
